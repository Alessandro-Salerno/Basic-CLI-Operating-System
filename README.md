# Writing an Operating System
This repository contains files related to the process of creating a **VERY** small operating system from scratch in C and Assembly for the Intel/AMD x86_64 platform.
The code is intended for OS-Beginners and students, but, given its unprofessional quality, it is adviced to avoid it in real-world projects.

## Code Style
There's no specific code style, naming convention or anything like it, I just tried to match the code style taught in schools to make it easier for students to understand. I know this may hurt some, so if you want to see some cleaner code, take a look at the [SalernOS-Kernel](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/SalernOS-Kernel)
